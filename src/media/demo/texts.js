    <p class="pb-4">Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin (English: /ˈpʊʃkɪn/;[1] Russian: Алекса́ндр Серге́евич Пу́шкин[note 1],
    tr. Aleksándr Sergéyevich Púshkin, IPA: [ɐlʲɪkˈsandr sʲɪrˈɡʲe(j)ɪvʲɪtɕ ˈpuʂkʲɪn] (About this soundlisten); 6 June
    [O.S. 26 May] 1799 – 10 February [O.S. 29 January] 1837) was a Russian poet, playwright, and novelist of the
    Romantic era[2] who is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet[3][4][5][6] and the founder of modern
    Russian literature.[7][8]
    <p class="pb-4">Pushkin[9] was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His father, Sergey Lvovich Pushkin, belonged
    to Pushkin noble families. His maternal great-grandfather was Central-African-born general Abram Petrovich
    Gannibal. He published his first poem at the age of 15, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by
    the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. Upon graduation from the Lycée, Pushkin recited his
    controversial poem "Ode to Liberty", one of several that led to his exile by Tsar Alexander I of Russia. While
    under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous
    play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832.
    <p class="pb-4">Pushkin was fatally wounded in a duel with his brother-in-law, Georges-Charles de Heeckeren
    d'Anthès, also known as Dantes-Gekkern, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment, who attempted
    to seduce the poet's wife, Natalia Pushkina.
    <h4 class="font:headline4 pt-6 pb-4">Ancestry</h4>
    <p class="pb-4">Pushkin's father, Sergei Lvovich Pushkin (1767–1848), was descended from a distinguished family of
    the Russian nobility that traced its ancestry back to the 12th century.[10] Pushkin's mother, Nadezhda (Nadya)
    Ossipovna Gannibal (1775–1836), was descended through her paternal grandmother from German and Scandinavian
    nobility.[11][12] She was the daughter of Ossip Abramovich Gannibal (1744–1807) and his wife, Maria Alekseyevna
    Pushkina (1745–1818).
    <p class="pb-4">Ossip Abramovich Gannibal's father, Pushkin's great-grandfather, was Abram Petrovich Gannibal
    (1696–1781), an African page kidnapped to Constantinople as a gift to the Ottoman Sultan and later transferred
    to Russia as a gift for Peter the Great. Abram wrote in a letter to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter,
    that Gannibal was from the town of "Lagon". Largely on the basis of a mythical biography by Gannibal's son-in-law
    Rotkirkh, some historians concluded from this that Gannibal was born in a part of what was then the Abyssinian
    Empire, located today in Ethiopia.[13] Vladimir Nabokov, when researching Eugene Onegin, cast serious doubt on this
    origin theory. Later research by the scholars Dieudonné Gnammankou and Hugh Barnes eventually conclusively
    established that Gannibal was instead born in Central Africa, in an area bordering Lake Chad in modern-day
    Cameroon.[13][14] After education in France as a military engineer, Gannibal became governor of Reval and
    eventually Général en Chef (the third most senior army rank) in charge of the building of sea forts and canals
    in Russia.
    <h4 class="font:headline4 pt-6 pb-4">Early life</h4>
    <p class="pb-4">Born in Moscow, Pushkin was entrusted to nursemaids and French tutors, and spoke mostly French
    until the age of ten. He became acquainted with the Russian language through communication with household serfs
    and his nanny, Arina Rodionovna, whom he loved dearly and was more attached to than to his own mother. He published
    his first poem at 15. When he finished school, as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious Imperial
    Lyceum in Tsarskoye Selo, near Saint Petersburg, his talent was already widely recognized on the Russian literary
    scene. After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of the capital, Saint
    Petersburg. In 1820, he published his first long poem, Ruslan and Ludmila, with much controversy about its subject
    and style.
    <h4 class="font:headline4 pt-6 pb-4">Social activism</h4>
    <p class="pb-4">While at the Lyceum, Pushkin was heavily influenced by the Kantian liberal individualist teachings
    of Alexander Petrovich Kunitsyn, whom Pushkin would later commemorate in his poem 19 October.[15] Pushkin also
    immersed himself in the thought of the French Enlightenment, to which he would remain permanently indebted
    throughout his life, particularly Diderot and Voltaire, whom he described as "the first to follow the new road,
    and to bring the lamp of philosophy into the dark archives of history".[16][17]
    <p class="pb-4">Pushkin gradually became committed to social reform and emerged as a spokesman for literary
    radicals. That angered the government and led to his transfer from the capital in May 1820.[citation needed] He
    went to the Caucasus and to Crimea and then to Kamianka and Chișinău in Moldavia, where he became a Freemason.
    <p class="pb-4">He joined the Filiki Eteria, a secret organization whose purpose was to overthrow Ottoman rule in
    Greece and establish an independent Greek state. He was inspired by the Greek Revolution and when the war against
    the Ottoman Turks broke out, he kept a diary recording the events of the national uprising.
    <h4 class="font:headline4 pt-6 pb-4">Rise</h4>
    <p class="pb-4">He stayed in Chișinău until 1823 and wrote two Romantic poems, which brought him acclaim: The
    Captive of the Caucasus and The Fountain of Bakhchisaray. In 1823, Pushkin moved to Odessa, where he again clashed
    with the government, which sent him into exile on his mother's rural estate of Mikhailovskoye (near Pskov) from
    1824 to 1826.
    <p class="pb-4">In Mikhaylovskoye, Pushkin wrote nostalgic love poems which he dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova,
    wife of Malorossia's General-Governor.[19] Then Pushkin continued work on his verse-novel Eugene Onegin.
    <p class="pb-4">In Mikhaylovskoye, in 1825, Pushkin wrote the poem To***. It is generally believed that he
    dedicated this poem to Anna Kern, but there are other opinions. Poet Mikhail Dudin believed that the poem was
    dedicated to the serf Olga Kalashnikova.[20] Pushkinist Kira Victorova believed that the poem was dedicated to the
    Empress Elizaveta Alekseyevna.[21] Vadim Nikolayev argued that the idea about the Empress was marginal and refused
    to discuss it, while trying to prove that poem had been dedicated to Tatyana Larina, the heroine of Eugene Onegin.
    <p class="pb-4">Authorities summoned Pushkin to Moscow after his poem "Ode to Liberty" was found among the
    belongings of the rebels from the Decembrist Uprising (1825). After his exile in 1820,[22] Pushkin's friends and
    family continually petitioned for his release, sending letters and meeting with Tsar Alexander I and then Tsar
    Nicholas I on the heels of the Decembrist Uprising. Upon meeting with Tsar Nicholas I Pushkin obtained his release
    from exile and began to work as the tsar's Titular Counsel of the National Archives. However, because insurgents
    in the Decembrist Uprising (1825) in Saint Petersburg had kept some of Pushkin's earlier political poems the tsar
    retained strict control of everything Pushkin published and he was unable to travel at will.
    <p class="pb-4">During that same year (1825), Pushkin also wrote what would become his most famous play, the drama
    Boris Godunov, while at his mother's estate. He could not however, gain permission to publish it until five years
    later. The original and uncensored version of the drama was not staged until 2007.
    <p class="pb-4">Around 1825–1829 he met and befriended the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, during exile in central
    Russia.[23] In 1829 he travelled through the Caucasus to Erzurum to visit friends fighting in the Russian army
    during the Russo-Turkish War.[24] In the end of 1829 Pushkin wanted to set off on a journey abroad, the desire
    reflected in his poem Поедем, я готов; куда бы вы, друзья...[25] He applied for permission for the journey, but
    received negative response from Nicholas I on 17 January 1830.[26]
    <p class="pb-4">Around 1828, Pushkin met Natalia Goncharova, then 16 years old and one of the most talked-about
    beauties of Moscow. After much hesitation, Natalia accepted a proposal of marriage from Pushkin in April 1830,
    but not before she received assurances that the Tsarist government had no intentions to persecute the libertarian
    poet. Later, Pushkin and his wife became regulars of court society. They officially became engaged on 6 May 1830,
    and sent out wedding invitations. Due to an outbreak of cholera and other circumstances, the wedding was delayed
    for a year. The ceremony took place on 18 February 1831 (Old Style) in the Great Ascension Church on Bolshaya
    Nikitskaya Street in Moscow. When the Tsar gave Pushkin the lowest court title, Gentleman of the Chamber, the poet
    became enraged, feeling that the Tsar intended to humiliate him by implying that Pushkin was being admitted to
    court not on his own merits but solely so that his wife, who had many admirers including the Tsar himself, could
    properly attend court balls.[citation needed]
    <p class="pb-4">In the year 1831, during the period of Pushkin's growing literary influence, he met one of Russia's
    other great early writers, Nikolai Gogol. After reading Gogol's 1831–1832 volume of short stories Evenings on a
    Farm Near Dikanka, Pushkin supported him and would feature some of Gogol's most famous short stories in the
    magazine The Contemporary, which he founded in 1836.

    <p class="pb-4">Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy[note 1] (/ˈtoʊlstɔɪ, ˈtɒl-/;[2] Russian: Лев Николаевич Толстой,
    [note 2] tr. Lev Nikoláyevich Tolstóy, IPA: [lʲef nʲɪkɐˈla(j)ɪvʲɪtɕ tɐlˈstoj] (About this soundlisten); 9
    September, [O.S. 28 August] 1828 – 20 November, [O.S. 7 November] 1910), usually referred to in English as Leo
    Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time.[3] He received
    nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature every year from 1902 to 1906 and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901,
    1902, and 1909. That he never won is a major controversy.[4][5][6][7]
    <p class="pb-4">Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828,[3] Tolstoy is best known for the novels War and
    Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1878),[8] often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction.[3] He first achieved
    literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth
    (1852–1856), and Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based upon his experiences in the Crimean War. His fiction includes
    dozens of short stories and several novellas such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886), Family Happiness (1859),
    and Hadji Murad (1912). He also wrote plays and numerous philosophical essays.
    <p class="pb-4">In the 1870s, Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an
    equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work A Confession (1882). His literal
    interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become a
    fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist.[3] His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The
    Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894), had a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as Mahatma
    Gandhi[9] and Martin Luther King Jr.[10] He also became a dedicated advocate of Georgism, the economic philosophy
    of Henry George, which he incorporated into his writing, particularly Resurrection (1899).
